Revision 231: (2011/05/08 Armin Biernaczyk)
- ovctcbef.pas
  TOvcTCBaseEntryField uses 'FDataStringType' to determine what kind of string is
  provided. Due to this change, the property 'DataStringType' can now be used for
  'TOvcPictureField' and 'TOvcSimpleField'.
  (So projects still using ShortStrings, like CustOrd.dpr, can use these cell
  components.)
- ovctcpic.pas and ovctvsim.pas
  The property 'DataStringType' has been made visible.

  containing aOvcTCCheckBox three times to change the checkbox' state

Revision 212: (2011/04/18 Armin Biernaczyk)
- ovctccbx.pas
  Bugfix: Comboboxes in Tables did not work because TOvcTCCustomComboBox.tcPaint
  provided a PChar instead of the expected PString for the inherited method.

Revision 210: (2011/04/17 Armin Biernaczyk)
Some bugfixes and changes regarding TOvcTable:
- The properties 'UseASCIIZStrings' and 'UsePString' of 'TOvcTCBaseString' were
  replaced by 'DataStringType':
  Both properties "tried" to define what kind of strings a cell is using, i.e. what
  kind of data the table expects for the cell when calling 'GetCellData'. For
  UseASCIIZStrings=True and UsePString=True (default) a pointer to a string was
  expected. This case worked.
  However, UseASCIIZStrings=False and UsePString=True did not work, as the cell still
  expected a PString when painting the cell - but a pointer to a ShortString when
  editing.
  To resolve this problem the two properties were replaced by 'DataStringType' with
  possible values 'tstString', 'tstShortString' and 'tstPChar'. This property tells
  the table what kind of strings are used to store the data. Of course 'tstString'
  is the default.
  See the example ExTbl10.dpr/ExTbl10_XE.dpr
- ovctcstr.pas
  Replaced properties 'UseASCIIZStrings' and 'UsePString' of 'TOvcTCBaseString' by
  'DataStringType'.

- ovctcbef.pas
  Bugfix in TOvcTCBaseEntryField.tcPaint.
- o32tcflx.pas
  Several changes due to replacing 'UseASCIIZStrings' and 'UsePString'.

- ovcCoco.pas
  Several Bugfixes to make it work in the unicode-world
- ovcdrpvw.pas
  Changed TOvcDataRvItem.ReadFromStream so that it can
  read from streams containing Ansi-strings in the
  unicode-world.
  (For example when opening ExDrv0.pas/.dfm in Delphi
   XE)
- ovcrvexp.pas
  Some Bugfixes to make it work in the unicode-world.
  Formated the code (which was an auto-generated mess)

Revision 207: (2011/04/16 Armin Biernaczyk)

- Ovcxfrc1.pas/dfm
  Minor bugfix for EntryFields with DataType char.
- OvcViewr.pas, OvcSfPe

  Removed redundant internal functions MinI, MaxI, MinL, MaxL
  (included OvcMisc.pas in uses-list instead)
- Ovcsc.pas, Ovcfsc.pas
  Moved internal assembler function(s) GetArrowWidth to OvcMisc.pas
  (and added PUREPASCAL-code)
- OvcMisc.pas
  Added PUREPASCAL code for functions CompStruct, MinI, MaxI,
  MinL, MaxL
- OvcEdit.pas
  modified code for TOvcCustomEditor.edRefreshLines to stop the
  editor repainting the entire ClientRect for every character
  that is being typed.
  Some code simplifictions in TOvcCustomEditor.Paint.
- OvcCalc.pas
  Fix for issue 3267487.

Revision 202: (2011/03/29 Armin Biernaczyk)
- ovcedit.pas
  New method TOvcCustomEditor.Text to access the editor's content as a
  string (instead of using PChar an GetText/SetText).
- ovcef.pas
  "upgraded" TOvcBaseEntryField.GetAsDateTime and .SetAsDateTime so
  that they work for (efDataType mod fcpDivisor) = fsubDouble:
  TOvcPictureFields with DataType=pftDateTime use this efDataType, so
  the extension is necessary to make TOvcPictureField.AsDateTime := ...
  work in case DataType=pftDateTime.
- ovcintl.pas
  Some extensions to use picture-masks containing both characters for
  date AND time. These are necessary for TOvcPictureFields with
  DataType=pftDateTime (e.g. PictureMask='dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss')
  The main problem here is that pmMonth=pmMinute...
  New method TOvcIntlSup.DateTimeToDatePChar to put date and/or time
  in a string based on a picture-string (needed for TOvcCustomPicture-
  Field.efTransfer; see below).
- ovcpf.pas
  Modified TransferString in TOvcCustomPictureField.efTransfer because
  the bugfix in rev 194 caused another problem when assigning a string
  to a picture field containing literals.
  Added a new transfer-procedure TransferDateTime in TOvcCustomPicture-
  Field.efTransfer to handle the case DataType=pftDateTime correctly.
  This did not work before.
  Modified TOvcCustomPictureField.pfGetDataType to return the proper
  type (fidPictureDouble instead of fidPictureDate) in case DataType=
  pftDateTime.
- ovcxfer.pas
  Major changes (see source) to transfer component data from and to
  data-records with different kind of string-types (string, array of char
  and shortstring)
  Upgraded to support TOvcEditor-components
- ovcxfrc1.pas/dfm
  Changes (and bugfixes) to reflect the new options offers by ovcxfer.pas

    (methods like 'DateToDateString' did not work properly due to bugs in this method)
  - Bugfix in TOvcIntlSup.MonthStringToMonth
    (due to this bug OvcPictureFields with mask='dd nnn yyyy' and DataType=pftDate did
    not recognise '01 Jan 2000' as a valid date.)

Revision 199: (2011/03/21 Armin Biernaczyk)
- ovcedit.pas
  Fixed issues 668026 and 755214 in TOvcCustomEditor

  highlighted properly (text and background were not aligned properly)

Revision 196: (2011/03/21 Armin Biernaczyk)
- ovcedit.pas
  bugfix: <tab>-characters were deleted from the file when saving it (issue 667991).
- ovcviewed.pas/dfm
  minor bugfix: Lists used in TfrmViewEd were not freed (issue 1056218)

Revision 194: (2011/03/19 Armin Biernaczyk)
- ovcpf.pas
  Minor bugfix: When transfering a string to the field (e.g. via AsString), the string
  was not merged with the PictureMask for datatype=pftString if the length of the
  string equaled MaxLength.

Revision 192: (2011/03/16 Armin Biernaczyk)

     LoCaseChar         - returned upper case character
     OctalLPChar        - unicode version did not work
     StrChDeletePrim    - both unicode & ansi-version failed for Pos=StrLen(P)
     StrChInsertPrim    - ansi-Version failed for Pos=StrLen(Dest)
     StrInsertChars     - did not work for Count>1024
     TrimEmbeddedZeros  - result was undefined for Pos('E',S)=0
     TrimTrailingZeros  - result was undefined for S=''
     TrimTrailPrimPChar - unicode-version deleted spaces only
                        - ansi-version did work properly for S = '  '

Revision 166: (2010/11/26 Armin Biernaczyk)
- TOvcTextFileEditor
  New property 'Encoding' (unicode-version)
  improved handling of encodings when loading/saving files:
  a) TOvcCustomTextFileEditor.SaveToFile
     If an encoding is passed to this method, it will be used even if not all the
     characters can be coded.
     If no encoding is specified, 'suggestEncoding' will be used to determine a suitable
     encoding: If possible 'Encoding' will be used. However, if not all characters can be
     coded, the method will use UTF8-encoding.
     One can check in advance whether 'Encoding' will not be used by comparing 'Encoding'
     with 'suggestEncoding'.
  b) TOvcCustomTextFileEditor.LoadFromFile
     If no encoding is passed to this method, it tries to derive the file's encoding from
     it's BOM and uses TEncoding.Default as default. Otherwise the given encoding is
     used as default. However, the given encoding will be ignored if the file's BOM indicates
     a different encoding.

     The used encoding is stored in 'Encoding' an will therefore be used when the file
     is saved later (see a).

- TOvcEditor
  Selecting/copying/pasting of rectangular blocks of text did not work properly when the text
  contained <tab>-characters

Revision 164: (2010/11/24 Armin Biernaczyk)
- TOvcTCBaseEntryField
  Fixed a bug in TOvcTCBaseEntryField: Datatransfer did not work and caused exceptions.

Revision 160: (2010/10/26 Armin Biernaczyk)
- TOvcEditor
  fixed wrong handling of TOvcUndoBuffer.BufAvail (unicode) that caused the TOvcEditor to
  crash after some editing.
  Improved performance of TOvcParaList.DeleteBlock (was quite slow when deleting a huge
  amount of paragraphs)
- TOvcCustomTextFileEditor
  Improved handling of different encodings (unicode)

Revision 156/157: (2010/10/23 Armin Biernaczyk)

  (TOvcEditor (unicode-version) now displays texts containing tab-characters correctly)

Revision 149: (2010/10/04 Armin Biernaczyk)
- TOvcEditor
  Added support for selecting/copying/pasting rectangular blocks of text (as in the Delphi IDE)
  does not yet work properly in case the text contains <tab>-characters.
  (As in the Delphi-IDE press <AltGr> when selecting text with the mouse)

Revision 147/148: (2010/10/04 Armin Biernaczyk)
- TOvcEditor
  Some bugs fixed in the Editor (unicode-version)

Revision 142: (2010/10/03 Armin Biernaczyk)
- TOvcEditor
  Implemented search functions (unicode-version)

Revision 49: (2009/11/28 Roman Kassebaum)
- TOvcTCCustomString and with it TOvcTCString uses PString. This means the in the OnGetCellText
  event handler should look like the following:
  Data := @FString; (with FString: string, not a ShortString or AnsiString).
  This is the first revision that allows to use the TOvcTCString under unicode.

Revision 48: (2009/11/28 Roman Kassebaum)
- Added the properties Adjust, Color and Font to the editor TOvcTCCustomControl.

Revision 47: (2009/11/25 Roman Kassebaum)
- TOvcTCColHead: Introduced the new property ShowEllipsis.

Revision 46: (2009/11/24 Roman Kassebaum)
- TOvcTCColHead: Fixed a big problem that occurs if the Ellipsis was shown.
  Previous revisions shouldn't be used any longer.

Revision 45: (2009/11/18 Roman Kassebaum)
- Added the new editor TOvcTCCustomInt for Integers. The OnGetCellText event handler should look like the following:
  OvcTCCustomInt1.IntToData(FInteger, Data, Purpose);
  The DoneEdit event handler must be assigned in the following way:
  FInteger := OvcTCCustomInt1.IntegerValue;

Revision 44: (2009/11/18 Roman Kassebaum)
- Added the new editor TOvcTCCustomStr which uses PChar. The OnGetCellText event handler should look like the following:
  OvcTCCustomStr1.StringToData(FString, Data, Purpose);
  Cause the TOvcTCCustomStr uses a PChar, the DoneEdit event handler must be assigned in the following way:
  FString := OvcTCCustomStr1.StringValue;
