***********************************************************************
3.      ovcoutln      fix  OvcOutline Stack overflow bug.
***********************************************************************
Fix by modifying the LocateNode procedure in the IndexFromNode function

4.      ovcsc         fix  OvcSpinner wouldn't re-initialize the
                           autorepeat sequence if AutoRepeat was 
                           toggled off in the OnClick event and toggled
                           back on outside of the event, such as in a 
                           timer.
***********************************************************************
Fix as follows...

Add a new SetAutoRepeat prototype to the TOvcSpinner class declaration
and modify the AutoRepeat property to write to the new procedure rather 
than the field itself.

  TOvcSpinner = class(TOvcCustomControl)
  protected {private}
    {property variables}
  << snip >>

    {property methods}
    procedure SetAcceleration(const Value : Integer);
    procedure SetAutoRepeat(Value: Boolean);                          {!!.01}
    procedure SetShowArrows(const Value : Boolean);

    property Delta : Double
      read FDelta write FDelta;
  << snip >>
  end;

Define the SetAutoRepeat implementation as follows...

<< snip >>

procedure TOvcSpinner.SetAcceleration(const Value : Integer);
begin
  if Value <= 10 then
    FAcceleration := Value;
end;

{!!.01 - begin}
procedure TOvcSpinner.SetAutoRepeat(Value: Boolean);
begin
  FAutoRepeat := Value;
  if FAutoRepeat then
    scDoAutoRepeat;
end;
{!!.01 - end}

5.      ovcclock      fix  The OvcClock's digital display does not 
                           display itself properly at construction and
                           it does not respect designtime settings at  
                           runtime.
***********************************************************************
Fix by modifying the DigitalOptions class' constructor and 
OvcCustomClock's Loaded procedure as follows...

constructor TOvcDigitalOptions.Create;
begin
  << snip >>
  MilitaryTime   := True;                                             {!!.01}

  ckDigitalOptionChange(self);                                        {!!.01}

  FActive := False;
  SetActive(HA);

6.      ovcreg        fix  The property editor for TO32Collection 
                           descendants registers itself for all 
                           TCollection descendants.
***********************************************************************
Fix by modifying ovcreg.pas as follows...

  << snip >>
  {register component editor for the sub-component list}
  RegisterPropertyEditor(TypeInfo(TOvcCollection),nil,'',TOvcCollectionEditor);
{!!.01}
  RegisterPropertyEditor(TypeInfo(TO32Collection),nil,'',TO32CollectionEditor);

                           violation when the IDE is closed.
***********************************************************************
This fix requires that you rebuild your Orpheus packages 
afterwards. Fix by checking that the controller exists before removing 
the hovertimer, as follows...

destructor TOvcCustomOutline.Destroy;
{Destroy report view component}
begin
  Clear;
  FOnActiveChange := nil;
  HintShownHere := True;
  if FHoverTimer <> -1 then begin
    if FController <> nil then                                        {!!.01}
      FController.TimerPool.Remove(FHoverTimer);
    FHoverTimer := -1;
  end;
  HintWindow.Free;
  FNodes.Free;
  LineCanvas.Free;
  NodeCache.Free;
  FAbsNodes.Free;
  FNodeIndex.Free;                                                             
  inherited Destroy;
end;

                           circumstances.
***********************************************************************
It's more of a workaround than a fix. In ovcpf.pas edit the efTransfer
function as follows...

function TOvcCustomPictureField.efTransfer(DataPtr : Pointer; TransferFlag : Word) : Word;
  {-transfer data to/from the entry fields}
var
  P      : PChar absolute DataPtr;
  SP     : ^ShortString absolute DataPtr;

      pftString   : TransferString;
      << snip >>

When packages are used, the window class is being registered in the package
(by TWinControl.CreateWnd). In TO32CustomFlexEdit.CreateWindowHandle, then,
you need to specify the instance to the package that registered the class
(VCL) instead of the current module (O4xx). The easiest way to do that is to
modify the CreateWindowHandle to use the instance from the class info being
passed in: (See changes marked with {!!.02})

procedure TO32CustomFlexEdit.CreateWindowHandle(const Params: TCreateParams);

see the "Recompiling Orpheus Packages" topic in the ReadMe.hlp file.

38.     OvcBase       fix  Many frame related problems.
***********************************************************************
There are many problems with frames mostly regarding the attached label
as well as the improper functioning of the OvcTable cells when the frame
is placed on a form.

The fix is simple.  In OvcBase there is a function called
GetImmediateParentForm.  A typo in this function prevented descendant
components from correctly identifying a TCustomFrame as the parent.

Fix by modifying GetImmediateParentForm as follows.

Note:  As this modifies designtime behaviour, you will need to rebuild
your orpheus packages.  For more information on rebuilding your packages,
see the "Recompiling Orpheus Packages" topic in the ReadMe.hlp file.

function GetImmediateParentForm(Control : TControl) : TWinControl;
  {return first form found while searching Parent}
var
  ParentCtrl : TControl;

  ParentCtrl := Control.Parent;

41.     OvcRptVw      enh  New property, SortDirection on view fields
***********************************************************************
A new published property, SortDirection, has been introduced on view
fields. It controls how a view column behaves when its header is clicked
by the user.

Definition:

        property SortDirection: TOvcRvFieldSort

        where

        TOvcRvFieldSort = (rfsFirstAscending, rfsFirstDescending,
            rfsAlwaysAscending, rfsAlwaysDescending);

The values have the following meaning

  rfsFirstAscending:   The first time the column is clicked, the column
                       is sorted in ascending order. Subsequent clicks
                       on the same column toggles the sort order to
                       descending then back to ascending, and so on.

                       This is the default value.

  rfsFirstDescending:  The first time the column is clicked, the column
                       is sorted in descending order. Subsequent clicks
                       on the same column toggles the sort order to
                       ascending then back to descending, and so on.

  rfsAlwaysAscending:  The column is always sorted in ascending order.

  rfsAlwaysDescending: The column is always sorted in descending order.

A corresponding property, DefaultSortDirection, has been introduced at the
global field level to allow definition of a default value to be used for
user-defined views.

Note that these new properties only control what the user can do by clicking
a column header. It is still possible to set the sort order to contradict
the value of the SortDirection property via code. Also, the value of the
SortDirection property has no influence on the default sort column or direction
on the view. If you wish to use a non-default (column zero, ascending) sorting
the first time a view is displayed, you must still set the appropriate values
on the view definition.

Code modifications too involved to show here.

45.     Many Files    fix  Hdc changed to TOvcHdc for BCB Compatibility
***********************************************************************
Note:  This fix requires many changes to many source files and is only 
recommended for those BCB users who are affected by the problem.  That 
is to say, only BCB users who are creating descendants of the affected 
classes.  This fix requires a rebould of all Orpheus packages and 
replacement of the BCB headers.

Now, On to the fix...
BCB treats an HDC as an Integer when it creates header files.  This 
causes problems when a user attempts to create descendant classes from 
Orpheus base classes in BCB.

The fix is to define TOvcHdc as an Integer when compiled under BCB and 
an Hdc when compiled under Delphi.  Every instance of an HDC being used 
in a parameter list must then be replaced with the new TOvcHdc.

operations that need to locate outline nodes by their current vertical
offset in the outline. It's default size is 4096 entries. The value should
preferably be greater or equal to the highest number of visible nodes in
the outline.

Custom view layouts that were deleted by the user would still be present

ignored.

                           disappear.
***********************************************************************
Changing the alignment on the FlexEdit caused the text to disappear.

The FlexEdit's multi-line behaviour was modeled after the TMemo.  While
investigating this problem, I noticed that the TMemo also doesn't work
properly.

The fix is to remove the overloaded WMPaint procedure and modify the
SetAlignment procedure to temporarily store the text while changing
alignment.
